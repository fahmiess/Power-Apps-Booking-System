# ðŸ“–Introduction
Managing meeting schedules manually can be time-consuming and inefficient for administrators. This Power Apps Booking System aims to reduce the adminâ€™s workload by allowing presenters to self-register their meeting slots, editing and deleting.

With this system, presenters can directly view available slots, register their presentations, and receive automated confirmation emails via Power Automate flows. The admin no longer needs to manually send emails or track individual meeting requests, significantly reducing man-hours spent on coordination.
